# Overview

Welcome to the official documentation of the Conductive Catalyst SDK ðŸ‘‹.

The goal of this document is to provide a brief overview of how to get started with Conductive.ai's SDK.

### What is Catalyst?

The core mission of Conductive.ai is to provide game developers with a simple yet effective rewards system that increases player engagement and consequently, user lifetime value (LTV). We do this by providing a simple drop-in SDK with minimal configuration, presenting players with a lucrative engagement framework.

### How does it work?

At present, we provide a Unity SDK (any native iOS and Android SDK upon request). Integration involves oneline of code, with no changes necessary to your existing code. Players are highly incentivized to perform actions directly correlated with engagement, retention, and monetization increasing your overall LTV over time.
