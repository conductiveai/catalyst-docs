# Overview

Welcome to the official documentation of the Conductive Catalyst SDK ðŸ‘‹.

The goal of this document is to provide a brief overview of how to get started with Conductive.ai's SDK.

### What is Catalyst?

The core mission of Conductive.ai is to provide game developers with a simple yet effective rewards system that increases player engagement and consequently, user lifetime value (LTV). We do this by providing a simple drop-in SDK with minimal configuration, presenting players with a lucrative engagement framework.

### How does it work?

At present, we provide a Unity SDK (any native iOS and Android SDK upon request). Integration involves oneline of code, with no changes necessary to your existing code. Players are highly incentivized to perform actions directly correlated with engagement, retention, and monetization increasing your overall LTV over time.

### The Role of the Developer

As a developer venturing into the Conductive.ai platform, your role is pivotal in shaping the gaming experience to not only meet but surpass the expectations of the user base. You have the responsibility and the creative freedom to tailor the Conductive.ai functionalities to seamlessly fit into the infrastructure of your game, creating a user journey that aligns with the goals and thematic coherence of your gaming environment.

In this context, you can adopt and integrate various tools and features offered by Conductive.ai, establish a rewards system that is both enticing and fair, and craft a user journey that is intuitive yet engaging. By leveraging the Conductive.ai platform, you can enhance user retention through a carefully strategized reward system, foster a competitive yet enjoyable gaming atmosphere through leaderboards and contests, and ensure the security and transparency of transactions.

Here is an overview of how a developer can use Conductive.ai to improve player lifetime value:
