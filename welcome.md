# Overview

Welcome to the official documentation of the Conductive Catalyst SDK ðŸ‘‹.

The goal of this document is to provide a brief overview on how to get started with our SDK.

### What is Catalyst

The core mission of Conductive is to provide game developers a simple yet effective rewards system that increases player engagement and consequently, LTV. We do this by providing a simple drop-in SDK with minimal configuration, presenting players with a lucrative engagement framework.

### How it works

At present we provide a Unity SDK (any native iOS and Android SDK if you ask). Integration is literally a one-line and no changes necessary to existing code. It simply just works. Players are highly incentivized to perform actions directly correlated with engagement, retention and monetization increasing your overall LTV over time.
